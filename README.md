### About the app

Although it’s a relatively simple app, as a developer, I always strive to prioritize user experience. I organized the visual elements to be clear and intuitive, and I included all the necessary visual feedback to make the interaction smoother. Loading and error states are displayed at the appropriate times. The app also supports both light and dark modes.

While exploring the APIs, I saw the opportunity to add a chart to the detail screen. I thought this would nicely complement the user experience by displaying a graph of the stock’s performance over the last two months, with a daily interval.

### About the code

My main goal with the code was to demonstrate my proficiency with iOS frameworks, particularly Foundation and UIKit. I also aimed to highlight my attention to code organization, writing clean, concise, and scalable code by applying Clean Architecture principles and the SOLID guidelines. The test coverage is around 85%. While some views weren’t tested, all business logic is covered by unit tests.
